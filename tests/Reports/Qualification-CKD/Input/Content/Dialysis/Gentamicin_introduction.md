Gentamicin is a bactericidal antibiotic derived from the bacteria, *Micromonospora purpurea*. Gentamicin is used to treat bacterial infections by the specific inhibition of normal protein synthesis in susceptible bacteria. These bacteria include, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *indole-negative* and indole-positive *Proteus* species, *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniæ*, *Enterobacter ærogenes*, *Serratia marcescens*, and *Staphylococcus* species. Gentamicin is indicated for treating serious infections caused by the aforementioned bacteria and specifically for the treatment of bacteremia, respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, infected wounds (surgical and traumatic), and bone and soft tissue infections.<sup>69</sup>

Gentamicin is typically given intramuscularly (IM), but the intravenous (IV) route can be reserved for when the intramuscular route is not feasible. When the drug is taken with IM administration, peak serum concentrations occur between 30 and 40 minutes.<sup>70</sup> Taken as an IV infusion over a 2 hour period, serum concentrations are similar to those seen from IM administration.

Studies have shown that the fraction unbound of gentamicin is between 0-30% depending on the method used for testing.<sup>70</sup> In healthy adults, 70% or more of the drug dose is found in urine after 24 hours of administration.<sup>70</sup> Gentamicin is primarily excreted by glomerular filtration and little metabolic transformation occurs. Its elimination half-life from plasma in healthy adults is approximately 2 hours.<sup>71</sup>
