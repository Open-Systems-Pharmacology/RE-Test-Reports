Atenolol is a beta-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. It is indicated for hypertension, angina pectoris due to coronary atherosclerosis, and acute myocardial infarction. Atenolol is 6-16% bound to proteins in plasma.<sup>47</sup> The elimination half-life of atenolol from plasma is 6-7 hours in healthy adults.

Taken orally, atenolol is classified as a BCS Class III drug (low permeability, high solubility) with incomplete absorption in humans. It undergoes little or no metabolism by the liver, and the portion that is absorbed is mainly eliminated by renal excretion with an active tubular secretion component.<sup>48</sup> Following oral administration, 50-60% of the dose is recovered in urine.<sup>48</sup> These findings suggested that atenolol is not fully absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and has a bioavailability of approximately 50%.<sup>48</sup>

Atenolol is a substrate of the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2/SLC22A2) on the basolateral side of renal tubular epithelial cells and is a substrate for the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion proteins (MATE1, MATE2/2-K) on the apical side.<sup>49</sup>
