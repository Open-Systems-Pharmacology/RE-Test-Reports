Vancomycin is a tricyclic glycopeptide antibiotic derived from the bacteria, *Amycolatopasis orientalis.*<sup>111</sup> The drug is indicated for the treatment of serious or severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant (Î²-lactam-resistant) staphylococci and staphylococcal endocarditis. It has also been reported to be an effective treatment of endocarditis caused by *S. viridans* or *S. bovis*, enterococci (only in combination with an aminoglycoside), and diphtheroid endocarditis.<sup>111</sup> Oral vancomycin is generally poorly absorbed after oral administration but has shown to be effective in treating staphylococcal enterocolitis and antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis caused by *C. difficile*.<sup>111</sup> Vancomycin is commonly used as a lyophilized powder for preparing IV infusions.

Vancomycin has a wide range of reported fraction unbound to protein, from 0-98%, although these differences are likely due to variations in assays, sample collection, and subjects used in the studies.<sup>112</sup> The elimination half-life of vancomycin from plasma is 4-6 hours in healthy adults.<sup>111</sup>

After the first 24 hours following administration, 75% of vancomycin is excreted unchanged in the urine and its concentration in liver tissue and bile were at or below detection limits.<sup>113</sup> These findings suggest that there is no apparent metabolism of vancomycin.
