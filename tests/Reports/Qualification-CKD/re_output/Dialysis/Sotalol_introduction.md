Sotalol is a methanesulfonanilide beta-blocker and class III antiarrhythmic drug that is used for the treatment of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. A two compartment model is often used to describe its linear pharmacokinetics after intravenous or oral administration.<sup>93</sup> It is a BCS class 1 drug that is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a bioavailability of 90-100%. Absorption may be decreased up to 20% when administered with food. It has a volume of distribution of 1.2 â€“ 2.4 L/kg and does not bind plasma proteins.

Sotalol is not metabolized and 80-96% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug with net active secretion. It is a substrate for the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2/SLC22A2) on the basolateral side of tubular cells and a substrate for the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion proteins (MATE1, MATE2/2-K) on the apical side.<sup>94</sup> The plasma half-life in healthy adults is 12 hours.
