With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a CKD PBPK model CKD according to the defined method. 

A population with Stage 3 CKD was created according to the demographic parameters of the target population presented in the study of Kirch 1981<sup>53</sup> (eGFR 37-60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Simulation of the pharmacokinetics of atenolol after multiple oral doses of 100 mg once daily for 7 days in this target population is presented in **Figure 3-9**.

A population with Stage 4 CKD was created according to the demographic parameters of the target population presented in the study of Kirch 1981<sup>53</sup> (eGFR 17-30 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Simulation of the pharmacokinetics of atenolol after multiple oral doses of 100 mg once daily for 7 days in this target population is presented in **Figure 3-10**.

A population with Stage 5 CKD was created according to the demographic parameters of the target population presented in the study of Kirch 1981<sup>53</sup> (eGFR 5-9 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Simulation of the pharmacokinetics of atenolol after multiple oral doses of 100 mg once daily for 7 days in this target population is presented in **Figure 3-11**.

A population with Stage 3 CKD was created according to the demographic parameters of the target population presented in the study of Sassard 1977<sup>65</sup> (eGFR 46-60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Simulation of the whole blood pharmacokinetics of atenolol after a single oral dose of 100 mg in this target population is presented in Figure **3-12**.

A population with Stage 4-5 CKD was created according to the demographic parameters of the target population presented in the study of Sassard 1977<sup>65</sup> (eGFR 8-24 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Simulation of the whole blood pharmacokinetics of atenolol after a single oral dose of 100 mg in this target population is presented in Figure **3-13**.

A population with Stage 3-4 CKD was created according to the demographic parameters of the target population presented in the study of Wan 1979<sup>55</sup> (eGFR 15-42 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Simulation of the pharmacokinetics of atenolol after a single oral dose of 50 mg in this target population is presented in Figure **3-14**.
