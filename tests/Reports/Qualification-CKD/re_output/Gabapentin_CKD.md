With the drug-specific parameters fixed, the healthy PBPK model was translated to a CKD PBPK model CKD according to the defined method. 

A population with Stage 3 CKD was created according to the demographic parameters of the target population presented in the study of Blum 1994<sup>34</sup> (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Simulation of the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin after a single oral dose of 400 mg in this target population is presented in **Figure 3-2**

A population with Stage 4-5 CKD was created according to the demographic parameters of the target population presented in the study of Blum 1994<sup>34</sup> (eGFR 1-30 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Simulation of the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin after a single oral dose of 400 mg in this target population is presented in **Figure 3-3**
