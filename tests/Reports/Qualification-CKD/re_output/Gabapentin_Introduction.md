Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). In adults, it is indicated for the management of post-herpetic neuralgia; and in adults and children 3 years and older with epilepsy, it is used as an adjunctive therapy in treating partial onset seizures with and without secondary generalization.

Gabapentin is available as a capsule, tablet, and oral solution. It is a BCS class 3 drug that is absorbed from the intestines by a process that is mediated by the active transporter, large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1, SLC7A5). This process is known to be saturable, with the bioavailability of gabapentin to be inversely proportional to the administered dose. The absolute oral bioavailability of a three times per day (tid) dosing regimen of 900, 1200, 2400, 3600, 4800 mg per day was 60, 47, 34, 33 and 27%, respectively.<sup>21</sup> The absolute bioavailability of the lowest dose of gabapentin tested (100 mg Q8h) was 80%.<sup>22</sup>

Gabapentin is not metabolized and completely renally cleared as unchanged drug by glomerular filtration at the maximal rate.<sup>23</sup> While gabapentin is a substrate of the OCT2 influx transporter in kidney, co-administration in humans with the OCT2 inhibitor cimetidine only reduced oral clearance of gabapentin by 14%.<sup>21</sup> This suggests that renal clearance is likely best described by the passive process of glomerular filtration only. Gabapentin has a volume of distribution of 58 ± 6 L (mean ± SD) with a half-life of 5-7 hours.<sup>21</sup> Additionally, it is 97% unbound in plasma.
