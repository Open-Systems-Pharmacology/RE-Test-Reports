The method to generate virtual populations with CKD was qualified by testing its predictive performance when used in combination with PBPK models for healthy subjects in order to predict the pharmacokinetics of drugs in patients with CKD from literature.

The method was evaluated using three compounds and first considers subjects with CKD (Stage 3 to Stage 5, end-stage renal disease) who are not on dialysis. The three compounds evaluated for the first qualification are gabapentin, acebutolol, and atenolol. This evaluation replicates in part the work published by Malik et al., 2020. The objective is to determine success of the population generation method by comparing the predicted pharmacokinetics in CKD to clinical pharmacokinetic data from literature. 

Each subsection that follows will contain an introduction to the test compound, a description of the healthy PBPK model development, and the subsequent translation to a population with CKD.
