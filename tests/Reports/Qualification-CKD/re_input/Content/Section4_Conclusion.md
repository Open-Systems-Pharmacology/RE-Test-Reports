Success of the virtual population with the test models for predicting drug pharmacokinetics in subjects with CKD qualifies the method to support the use of the population for PBPK-CKD modeling.

The evaluation was performed for compounds with significant renal elimination, for compounds subject to active transport through the OCT system, and compounds with non-renal elimination pathways that are largely conserved in subjects with CKD. The population parameters are intended to account for the underlying anatomy and physiology changes that occur in subjects with varying stages of CKD. Specific parameterizations from the user may be necessary for drug-specific cases where non-renal elimination pathways are affected by the disease (e.g., a metabolic enzyme) or where a transport pathway is significantly compromised (e.g., the OAT system).
