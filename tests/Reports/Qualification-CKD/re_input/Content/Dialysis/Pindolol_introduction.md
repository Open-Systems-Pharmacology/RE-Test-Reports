Pindolol is a non-cardioselective beta adrenergic blocking agent with antihypertensive and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. It is primarily used for rate control in atrial fibrillation and is indicated for treatment of hypertension. Classified as a BCS Class I drug (high solubility and high permeability), pindolol is taken orally and rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability of 90-100%. It is about 40% bound to plasma proteins and in turn, has a high fraction unbound. The plasma half-life of pindolol is 3-4 hours in healthy adults.

Pindolol undergoes extensive metabolism in animals and humans. In humans, approximately 60-65% of pindolol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2D6 primarily into hydroxy-metabolites which are excreted as glucuronides and ethereal sulfates. The remaining 35-40% is excreted unchanged in the urine with a net active section. It is a substrate and an inhibitor for the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2/SLC22A2) on the basolateral side of tubular cells and is a substrate for the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion proteins (MATE1, MATE2/2-K) on the apical side.
